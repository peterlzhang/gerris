User guide for RStarTree Version R2.xx (VR2.xx)
-----------------------------------------------

The files "RStarTree.h", "RSTBase.h" and "libcSmRST.a" should reside in the
directory, where this README file resides. We will call this directory "dest".
RStarTree.h is the user interface. RSTBase.h is a private header file included
by RStarTree.h. Provided that, RSTREE is a typed pointer (not a void).

SYNOPSYS

Compilation:
#include "dest/RStarTree.h"

Linking:
-Ldest -lcSmRST

The usage of the RStarTree implementation is explained in RStarTree.h.
You might have a look at dest/src/trst.c as an example as well. trst uses a
little set implementation also located in dest/src.
Installation hints you'll find in dest/src/READMEInstall.
