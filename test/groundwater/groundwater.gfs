# Title: Simple example of groundwater flow following Darcy's law
#
# Description:
#
# The simplest model of groundwater flow is provided by Darcy's law
# \cite{bear88}: construed on the macroscopic scale, at
# which individual pores are invisible, the `discharge' velocity
# $\mathbf u$ is divergence-free
# \begin{displaymath}
# \nabla\cdot\mathbf u = 0
# \end{displaymath} 
# and proportional to the hydraulic gradient $\nabla p$:
# \begin{displaymath} 
# \mathbf u = - k\nabla p\,.
# \end{displaymath}
#
# The coefficient of proportionality $k$ is known as the permeability
# or hydraulic conductivity, and may in general vary from place to
# place or be a second-order tensor; for this first test it is taken
# as constant.
#
# Such a problem can be solved by Gerris using its projection method:
# one turns off the advection and does not activate viscosity.
# Darcy's law itself is provided by linear implicit
# \texttt{GfsSourceCoriolis} terms.  The standard
# \texttt{GfsSimulation} solver then works as a false-transient
# iteration toward the steady-state, which will be correct if the
# pressure converges, implying a divergence-free discharge velocity.
#
# The following example is based on Figure 5-3 of
# Harr~\cite{harr77}[p.~146], but converted from rectangular to
# circular geometry so as to permit a simple closed-form solution: a
# uniform aquifer confined to an annular sector, with impermeable arcs
# and different constant heads imposed on the two radii.  The exact
# solution has the head constant along radii and varying linearly with
# angle.
