# Title: Groundwater flow with piecewise constant permeability
#
# Description:
#
# Discontinuities of hydraulic conductivity are common in groundwater
# flow.  They can be handled by Gerris's projection method using the
# \texttt{alpha} keyword in \texttt{GfsPhysicalParams}.
#
# Even with nonuniform porosity, the discharge velocity will be
# divergence-free \cite[p.~198]{bear88} (assuming only that the local
# liquid density is constant).  Applying that condition to Darcy's
# flux law yields
# \begin{displaymath}
#   \nabla\cdot\left(k\nabla p\right) = \nabla\cdot\mathbf u\,,
# \end{displaymath}
# which closely resembles the projection Poisson equation used in
# Gerris~\cite[eq.~7]{popinet2009}:
# \begin{displaymath}
#   \nabla\cdot\left[\frac{\Delta t}{\rho_{n+\frac{1}{2}}} \nabla
#   p_{n+\frac{1}{2}}\right] = \nabla\cdot\mathbf u_{*}.
# \end{displaymath}
# noting that the (here false) time-step $\Delta t$ will be uniform in
# space and so can be taken outside the divergence, all that is
# required is to identify the `density' $\rho_{n+\frac{1}{2}}$ with
# something inversely proportional to the permeability.  As Gerris is
# told about this density via its reciprocal \texttt{alpha} in
# \texttt{GfsPhysicalParams}, we just that proportional to
# permeability.
#
# In many soils, the permeability varies in proportion to the
# porosity~\cite[p.~94]{harr77}, so this \texttt{alpha} factor can be
# seen as the porosity too, in which case it reflects the difference
# between the `discharge' and `seepage' velocities, the first being
# the one that is calculated by Gerris and corresponding to
# macroscopic measurements while the latter is that in the pores.  The
# relation between the two is simply that the discharge velocity is
# the seepage velocity times the porosity~\cite[p.~23]{bear88}.
#
# Here we modify the first example by halving the porosity in the last
# third of the aquifer (so that it has the same total hydraulic
# resistance as the first two thirds).  The exact solution has the
# velocity field exactly as before, but with a steeper azimuthal
# pressure gradient beyond porosity jump at $\theta < -\pi/3$.
