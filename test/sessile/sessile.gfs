# Title: Sessile drop
# 
# Description:
#
# A sessile drop is a drop of liquid at rest on a solid surface. In
# the absence of gravity, the shape of the drop is controlled by
# surface tension only. An important parameter is the "contact angle"
# $\theta$ between the solid surface and the interface. In the absence
# of gravity, the drop is hemispherical and it is easy to show that
# the relation between the radius of the drop $R$ and its volume $V$
# is (for two-dimensional drops)
# $$V=R^2(\theta-\sin\theta\cos\theta)$$
#
# To test this relation, a drop is initialised as a half-disk
# (i.e. the initial contact angle is 90$^\circ$) and the contact angle
# is varied between 30 and 180$^\circ$. The drop oscillates and
# eventually relaxes to its equilibrium position. This equilibrium is
# exact to within machine accuracy (for most contact angles). The
# curvature along the interface is constant. Figure \ref{rk}
# illustrates the dependence of the equilibrium radius $R$ as a
# function of the contact angle $\theta$ (for a constant volume
# $V$). The method is between first- and second-order accurate (Figure
# \ref{convergence}).
